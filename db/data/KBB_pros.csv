While any number of manufacturers will adapt key elements of BMW's mainstay into their product portfolio, no one - to date - has duplicated the 3's seductive combination of performance, handling and day-to-day utility. Drivers love it, geeks (especially those with an affinity for elegant engineering) love it, and families love it. True, Audi is making inroads into the American consciousness, and Infiniti's G37 represents a compelling performance alternative, but neither puts it all together quite like BMW.

BMW,4 Series,2018,"The 4 Series coupe and convertible are essentially 2-door versions of the BMW 3 Series. If you want the well-regarded driving dynamics of that sedan in a sleeker package or with a retractable-hardtop roof, the 4 Series is it. As for the 4-door Gran Coupe, it blends fine handling, sharp looks and strong practicality."
BMW,4 Series,2017,"The BMW 4 Series is in reality a 3 Series coupe, and if you're looking for the driving dynamics of that sedan but in a sleeker package, you've found your ride. As for the 4-door Gran Coupe? It's as practical as it is beautiful thanks to its spacious hatch."

BMW,4 Series,2014,"If you want to be seen in a prestigious 2-door sports car with German badge appeal and performance chops, get ready to be among the first to own the new 4 Series. Drivers who live where it snows will be happy to know all-wheel-drive versions are part of the lineup, convertibles included."
BMW,5 Series,2019,"This is the car to get if you want it all. Equipment, driving talent, technology, prestige and space. Anything bigger and with more toys starts to get increasingly compromised by weight, as well as bordering on the extravagant."
BMW,5 Series,2018,"If you want a midsize-luxury sedan with all the expected premium trappings, loads of technology and an edge for drivers who favor sporty driving dynamics, the 2018 BMW 5 Series remains the one to beat. Powertrains now range from fuel-miserly 4-cylinder models to a voracious V8 with all-wheel drive."
BMW,5 Series,2017,"If you want a midsize-luxury sedan with all the expected premium trappings, loads of technology and an edge for drivers who enjoy engaging manners, the 2017 BMW 5 Series remains the one to beat. A pedigree spanning over four decades doesn't hurt, either."
BMW,5 Series,2016,"If you’re seeking perfection in performance, image and luxury, you’ll find BMW’s new 5 Series is on a similar quest. From the fuel-efficient diesel and 4-cylinder turbo to the fire-breathing M5, there is a 5 Series sedan to please just about every desire."

BMW,5 Series,2013,"While the majority of its competition tend to lean in a particular direction when it comes to comfort, performance and practicality, the 2013 BMW 5 Series offers equal quantities of all three, even in base form. Additionally, if a third pedal is a requirement in your next luxury-sports sedan, the 5 Series is the only car in the category to offer a manual transmission.
"
BMW,5 Series,2012,"If you desire a balanced approach to performance, comfort and practicality – and want all three in a reasonably sized sedan – few cars can match the menu provided by BMW’s 5 Series. And if, perchance, you’re one of the few capable of coordinating your left foot with your right hand, BMW is one of the very few automakers providing the above with a manual transmission – in the 535i and 550i."

Dodge,Charger,2016,"There are lots of choices in 4-door sedans, but few with the 2016 Charger’s attitude. The “base” engine is a 292-horsepower V6, with three available Hemi V8s (three!), the pinnacle being the SRT Hellcat with its 707-horsepower supercharged Hemi and a price under $70 grand. What’s not to like?"
Dodge,Charger,2015,"Where else can you buy a sedan that packs 707 horsepower for less than six figures? The Charger SRT Hellcat is a steal in every sense of the word. You don’t have to sacrifice livability with the Charger SRT Hellcat (or any of the Charger variants, for that matter) either."

Dodge Challenger, but your daily chores include shuttling more than two people to and fro, the 2012 Dodge Charger makes for a great alternative.

"
Dodge,Charger,2011,"If you need room for family members or business clients, but can't stand the thought of driving a generic four-door 
sedan, the 2011 Dodge Charger may be your savior. With a 292-horsepower V6 and an available 370-horsepower Hemi V8, the Charger can easily satisfy your need for speed as well as provide a comfortable perch for four adults."

Honda,Accord,2018,"If you’re looking for a reasonably priced midsize family sedan with the latest in driver safety, suspension and infotainment technology, the new 2018 Honda Accord leads the pack. Dynamic styling, class-leading fuel economy, a massive rear seat, and Honda’s reputation for excellence are also along for the ride. There are even Accord Hybrid variants for those seeking superior fuel economy."
Honda,Accord,2017,"The Accord's formula for four decades of success remains today: It's efficient, reliable, safe, stylish and a value now and in the long-run. A variety of models and trims -- from a manual-transmission coupe or sedan to an ultra-fuel-efficient hybrid -- only sweetens the 2017 Accord's overall proposition."

Honda,Accord,2014,"Beyond its history of reliability and high resale value, the Accord is now more varied than ever. Whether you want a no-fuss and highly economical sedan, a sporty V6-powered coupe or a hybrid that attains 50 mpg in the city, the 2014 Accord offers something for everyone."
Honda,Accord,2013,"The Honda Accord is the Labrador retriever of sedans. If you want a hassle-free, pleasing family car with a reputation for quality and an immediate familiarity, it's hard to go wrong with the Accord. Coupe versions, meanwhile, add an element of sportiness, especially when fitted with the strong V6 engine."
Honda,Accord,2012,"The 2012 Accord Sedan combines outstanding value, excellent driving dynamics, a roomy and comfortable passenger cabin, and sporty styling vaguely similar to some BMW sedans. If your budget says ""simple family sedan,"" but your brain says ""I deserve better,"" you'll probably find the Accord sedan can satisfy both needs.

Lexus,IS,2016,"You’ve reached a point where you can drive what you want and don’t care what others think. What you want is a luxury sedan with striking looks, great driving and flawless quality. You’re a competent driver. You shop around. You choose the Lexus IS. You’re very happy with your decision."
Lexus,IS,2015,"If you're looking for an entry-level luxury sedan, but want something with dynamically out-there styling to back up its driving characteristics, you can't do better than the 2015 Lexus IS sedan. Yeah, we just said a Lexus is the most visually striking sedan in its class. How times change."
Lexus,IS,2014,"Opting for the most visually appealing vehicle in a particular segment can sometimes mean settling for less when it comes to long-term reliability and value.

Lexus,IS,2013,"If you appreciate the aggressive styling of contemporary sports cars, but crave the refinement and comfort of a luxury sedan, the 2013 Lexus IS is tough to beat.

Lexus,IS,2012,"If, in a sport sedan, you find a level of refinement fully appropriate to your transportation mission, the 
2012 Lexus IS 250 or IS 350 delivers that refinement in spades. It may lack the ferocity of a 
BMW 3 Series (unless opting for the IS F), and falls short of the 
Audi A4 in high-tech cool but the Lexus goes about its business both quickly and oh-so-capably, and can do so long after its warranty has expired."
Lexus,IS,2011,"If you're stuck on Lexus' quality, sales experience and resale value, but you find some of their offerings a bit tame, test drive a 2011 Lexus IS 250 or 2011 Lexus IS 350. The sharp styling, impressive handling and potent engine choices may change your mind."
Lexus,IS,2010,"You might like the 2010 Lexus IS C if you're in the market for a sporty, luxurious convertible. Along with open-air fun, the IS C provides much of the refinement, security and style of a coupe, thanks to its retractable metal roof."

Lexus,LS,2012,"Any of the LS variants is built with a comfort bias, which isn't a bad thing in a luxury sedan. And if – in making an investment north of $70,000 – you care to hold onto it past the payment period, there's a lot to be said for older Japanese vis-à-vis older German. Lexus holds its high resale value, in part, because of better long-term reliability."

Maserati,Ghibli,2016,"If, above all else, your car needs to be a statement to equal your sense of style, few will accomplish that goal like a Maserati. The 2016 Ghibli brings more exoticness to the parking lot than any roughly comparable sports sedan from BMW, Audi, Mercedes-Benz or Jaguar."
Maserati,Ghibli,2015,"If you desire an expensive, slightly exotic midsize luxury performance sedan and value esthetics above all else, Maserati’s Ghibli for 2015 may do more to light your fire than an Audi A6 or 
Jaguar XF."
Maserati,Ghibli,2014,"If you are tired of seeing buyers of premium midsize sedans bringing home one of the Germans (
Audi A6, 
BMW 5 Series, Mercedes-Benz E-Class) and you desire real flair and a spirited drive for four adults (though it's technically a 5-seater), while having ample room inside and unique personalization options, then shop the 2014 Maserati Ghibli."
Maserati,Quattroporte,2018,"Whether you desire a large executive sedan that automatically gets the VIP treatment in the valet line or whose soundtrack will always remind you it houses a Ferrari-built engine under the hood, the 2018 Maserati Quattroporte brings the cachet if you bring the cash."
Maserati,Quattroporte,2017,"The 2017 Maserati Quattroporte offers style, power, exclusivity and panache that you can't get in any other sedan at its roughly $100,000 starting price. With a Ferrari-developed V8 under the hood -- and the sounds to prove it -- it almost seems like a bargain."
Maserati,Quattroporte,2016,"If you want a full-size luxury sedan with exclusivity, panache, power and exquisite style, the Maserati Quattroporte is hard to beat. With a price starting around $100,000, all this is can be yours at a price that's less than the famed trident badge may suggest."
Maserati,Quattroporte,2015,"Those seeking a high level of luxury, performance and styling with the added caveat that it must also be exclusive will find much to love in the 2015 Maserati Quattroporte sedan. Unless you live abroad, we promise you won’t find a sea of similar cars in the Neiman-Marcus parking lot."
Maserati,Quattroporte,2014,"Because of its exclusivity, Italian design, high level of interior craftsmanship, and solid performance, the Maserati Quattroporte stands apart from other entries in the luxury market. Its distinctiveness also increases the chance that the valet will park your car out front."
Maserati,Quattroporte,2013,"If you are right-brain dominant, the Quattroporte will whisper sweet nothings into your lusty imagination. Maserati's 4-door luxury sedan is prettier than a 
Porsche Panamera, sexier than an 
Audi A8, and way more vocal than a Jaguar XJL."
Maserati,Quattroporte,2012,"If you are right-brain dominant, the Quattroporte will whisper sweet nothings in your imaginative, emotional noggin. Maserati’s 4-door luxury sedan is prettier than a

Maserati,Levante,2019,"Have you grown tired of seeing all those Audi, BMW, Mercedes and Lexus SUVs? If so, the Maserati Levante is for you. This exclusive SUV is as practical as most of its rivals, but it backs up its killer performance with Italian spirit and style."
Maserati,Levante,2018,"If your neighborhood is filled with Audi, BMW and Lexus SUVs, driving a 2018 Maserati Levante will set you apart in spectacular fashion. The Levante is similarly sized and priced with most rivals, so you don’t have to sacrifice practicality for exclusivity."
Maserati,Levante,2017,"If you’re looking for distinctive, stand-out styling and solid performance, just hearing the roar of its twin-turbo V-6 will be worth the price for some buyers. While Maserati’s quality hasn’t quite matched rivals, like Porsche, the new Levante would be worth considering for those who don’t want yet another German SUV."
Maserati,GranTurismo,2018,"Even among 6-figure luxury-performance cars, the 2018 Maserati GranTurismo coupe and convertible stand out for their Italian design, Ferrari-built engine and sheer exclusivity. Driving a Maserati grants immediate access to a privileged group."
Maserati,GranTurismo,2017,"The 2017 Maserati GranTurismo is perfect for anybody looking for a 4-passenger luxury-sports coupe or convertible offering the Italian style and personality that you just can't get in a BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche or Aston Martin. The rarity and heavenly powertrain are practically icing on the cake."
Maserati,GranTurismo,2016,"If you want a 4-passenger luxury sports coupe or convertible that's more exclusive than a BMW, Mercedes-Benz or even a Porsche, the Maserati GranTurismo could be the answer. This particular answer also brings jaw-dropping looks, a heavenly powertrain and the envy of friends and neighbors alike."
Maserati,GranTurismo,2015,"It's simple: If you want a fast, sexy, Italian coupe that looks like nothing else, comes with a pedigreed name, and will make the owners of other exotics look twice, then the Maserati GranTurismo is your ride."
Maserati,GranTurismo,2014,"The 
Maserati GranTurismo is for those looking for a uniquely Italian alternative to cars like the 
Audi R8, Jaguar XKR and Porsche 911. Driven by emotion, and a powerful V8, it's a perfect companion for the open road."
Maserati,GranTurismo,2013,"If you wear your emotions on your sleeves, the 2013 Maserati GranTurismo will have you rolling them up and taking to the open road. The 
Audi R8, Jaguar XKR and Mercedes-Benz CL550 may be defensible alternatives, but they lack the uniquely Italian vivaciousness of this gorgeous 2+2 GT.

MAZDA,MAZDA3,2018,If you want more than four wheels and a steering wheel. If you want to like your car. If you want to want your car. If you want to feel something when you drive your car. If you believe life is too short to drive an ugly car you’ll like the 2018 Mazda3.
MAZDA,MAZDA3,2017,"The 2017 Mazda3 compact sedan is the kind of car that satisfies many needs. It can be a frugal economy car, yet still satisfy the most demanding enthusiast. A sleek exterior is matched by a handsome interior, with plenty of cutting-edge safety and convenience features from which to choose."
MAZDA,MAZDA3,2016,"The Mazda3 is like that beautiful person who also happens to be smart, charming and fun. We suggest getting to know that kind of person at a dinner party the same way we recommend putting the Mazda3 at the top of your small-car consideration list."
MAZDA,MAZDA3,2015,"If you're seeking a compact sedan or hatchback with fun driving manners, great fuel economy, and class-above looks and features, the Mazda3 is an excellent choice. That Mazda's compact car starts under $18,000 and retains its value very well is icing on the cake."
MAZDA,MAZDA3,2014,"Its 3rd-generation remake has given the Mazda3 a far more engaging personality that encompasses both its visual and functional elements. The new Mazda3 drives as great as it looks, and introduces new technology and safety features not found in any of its current class rivals."
MAZDA,MAZDA3,2013,"If you want a compact sedan or hatchback that's both fun to drive and fuel-efficient, the 2013 Mazda3 makes an excellent choice. Strong resale value means it's a good bet in the long run, too."
MAZDA,MAZDA3,2012,"Great gas mileage and an enthusiast-oriented chassis are fused with a premium interior and dynamite styling to form the 2012 Mazda3 sedan and hatchback. If you thought you couldn't have all this in a small affordable car, Mazda just proved you wrong."
MAZDA,MAZDA3,2011,"To receive a full dose of ""zoom-zoom"" one would assume you go to the RX-8 or an aftermarket-infused Miata. In doing so you'd be missing a huge opportunity in the 5-door segment. The Mazdaspeed3 takes all of the goodness of its donor 5-door and adds a healthy dose of excitement, along with bike racks, grocery bags and baby seats. If you believe in raising children in the fast lane (rather than a school zone), this is what you'll buy."
MAZDA,MAZDA3,2010,"Fans of the previous MAZDA3, who want something that offers a new level of style and sophistication with better overall performance and handling, plus improved fuel economy, should be well pleased with the 2010 version."
MAZDA,MAZDA3,2009,"If you're in the market for a compact pocket rocket that can also serve as a daily driver, the MAZDASPEED3 should be at the top of your list. With a sub six-second zero to 60-mph time and a top speed of 155 miles per hour, there's nothing in this price range that can match the 2009 MAZDASPEED3's performance."
MAZDA,MAZDA3,2008,"If you're shopping for an economical small car that can be nicely equipped for around $18,000, check out the 
2008 Mazda MAZDA3. Sharp styling and road-hugging handling are standard, as is a long list of uncommon options such as DVD navigation and Bose audio."

MAZDA,MAZDA6,2019,"First, congratulations for thinking outside the crossover-SUV box. The 2019 Mazda6 midsize sedan is stylish, well equipped, fuel-efficient, safe, reliable, comfortable, upscale and fun. If that sounds like your ideal car, then your search has ended.

"
MAZDA,MAZDA6,2018,"If you’re looking for a stylish and well-equipped midsize family sedan with top safety ratings, fuel-efficient engines and a well-earned reputation for reliability, you’ll like the new 2018 Mazda6.

Throw in impressive efficiency, great looks and -- for those who wish -- a crisp manual transmission, and you've got a winner."
MAZDA,MAZDA6,2016,"If you're looking for a midsize sedan that's fun to drive, fuel-efficient and stylish, it's hard to beat the Mazda6. Base models have an alluring starting price under $22,500, while top-line trims offer features like automatic emergency braking and radar-based cruise control."

MAZDA,MAZDA6,2013,"If exterior styling is a key consideration when purchasing your next family sedan, the 2013 Mazda6 should definitely strike a chord. A firm suspension, tight steering and powerful V6 backup the car's sporty attitude."

"
MAZDA,MAZDA6,2011,"If you've been impressed by Mazda's previous lineup - including its volume leader, the Mazda3 - the Mazda6 is an excellent way for a growing family to move up. While not the sport-oriented platform enjoyed by its predecessor, the newest Mazda6 retains fun-to-drive elements, while offering far more interior volume for passengers and cargo.

Wagon might be the vehicle for you."

MAZDA,CX-3,2019,"Flair, finesse and foul-weather traction are priorities in a subcompact-crossover SUV. And even though the new CX-3 doesn’t have abundant rear-passenger space, fold those rear seats down and the cargo area expands to a useful 44.5 cubic feet."
MAZDA,CX-3,2018,"If you’re looking for a subcompact with an all-weather drivetrain, racy good looks and exemplary ride and handling characteristics, we think Mazda’s 2018 CX-3 deserves a test drive.

MAZDA,CX-5,2018,"If you’re looking for a small SUV that rides and handles like a sporty hatchback (think Mazda3), the 2018 Mazda CX-5 stands above all rivals. Excellent fuel economy from an available diesel engine further separates the CX-5 from the Honda CR-V, Nissan Rogue and Ford Escape."
MAZDA,CX-5,2017,"If you want a small SUV that is fun to drive, boasts stylish design and has impressive standard safety features such as automatic emergency braking, the CX-5 checks all the right boxes. Loaded up in Grand Touring form, it could give luxury-compact SUVs a run for their money."
MAZDA,CX-5,2016,"If you want a small, stylish, fun-to-drive SUV, you'll find it in the CX-5. If you're among the few who prefer a manual transmission, this Mazda boasts one of the best available in an SUV. Fuel economy of up to 35 mpg and a sub-$23,000 starting price are added icing."

MAZDA,CX-9,2017,"If your heart yearns for something sporty but reality necessitates an SUV, the 2017 Mazda CX-9 will satisfy both.

MAZDA,CX-9,2016,"The 2016 Mazda CX-9 puts the ""fun"" in ""functional."" If you want a mainstream 3-row SUV that is an adept family vehicle for school drop-offs and a rewarding personal vehicle for a spirited trip to the office or couples weekend getaway, this is it."

minivan or station 
wagon, the 2012 Mazda CX-9 SUV will bring a smile to your face."

Open-air fans will find lots to like, especially the Miata's sub-$25,000 starting price. Those who live in cold climates will appreciate the retractable hardtop option."
MAZDA,MX-5 Miata,2011,"If you enjoy an immediate connection between steering wheel and roadway, you'll revel in the performance of the MX-5 Miata. There is absolutely nothing extraneous to the architecture, and while its footprint may be an expansion on the '60s-era Lotus that inspired it, there are few cars today - and virtually none in the U.S. market - that better combine fun, efficiency and affordability. And its hardtop (now about 2/3 of sales) makes the Miata amenable to most climes."

Its sophisticated interior and features will appeal to your techy side, while its zero-emissions appeal to your inner earth child."
Nissan,LEAF,2015,"Do you stand in line to get the latest iDevice? Do you not just separate your recyclables, but sort them into glass, paper, and plastic, too? The 2015 Nissan Leaf appeals to eco-friendly early adopters who can live with its limitations, not a huge group, but a sought-after one."
Nissan,LEAF,2014,"Looking to reduce your carbon footprint and never visit a gas station again? The 2014 Nissan Leaf is the everyman's EV to beat. And thanks to a lower entry price that took effect last year, Nissan's electric car undercuts rivals such as the Ford Focus EV and Fiat 500e."
Nissan,LEAF,2013,"Whether you seek to reduce your carbon footprint, eliminate fuel costs, or simply despise gas stations, the all-electric 2013 Nissan Leaf won't disappoint. In addition, the Leaf's new pricing strategy proposes a strong affordability advantage over competitors like the 
Ford Focus EV, 
Honda Fit EV, and plug-in 
Chevrolet Volt."

"
Nissan,LEAF,2011,"No question that card-carrying Greenies who think EVs are the future and the future is now will love the new 
Nissan LEAF. Others will simply have to decide if a vehicle with its admirable cost-to-benefit ratio makes the most sense as a second or third commuter car or as a substitute for a conventional 
hybrid."

A zero-to-60-mph time under three seconds and a top speed of 196 mph place the GT-R in a very exclusive club."
Nissan,GT-R,2018,"If you live in a place where Porsches are as common as Uber, the 2018 Nissan GT-R affords the opportunity to drive a seldom-seen performance machine. With a sub-3-second sprint to 60 and top speed of 196 mph, even when the GT-R is spotted, it won’t be for long."

Nissan,GT-R,2016,"If you want a car that goes from zero to 60 mph in under three seconds on its way to a 196-mph top speed, sends 545 horsepower to all four wheels, and seats four, all for about $100,000, then the 2016 Nissan GT-R is your only bet."

Nissan,GT-R,2012,"Unlike Europe, where exotic cars seem to proliferate like rabbits, in the U.S. a car like the 2012 Nissan GT-R coupe is a coveted possession. If you're looking for cutting-edge performance in a fairly exclusive car, the GT-R is likely to be far more satisfying than a 
BMW M3, Audi R8 or 
Chevrolet Corvette Z06.
"
Nissan,GT-R,2011,"There are so few exotic cars sold in the United States that, for the well-to-do gear head, owning a car like the 2011 Nissan GT-R is almost a must. From its terrifyingly quick acceleration to its unimpeachable handling and braking, the GT-R is Nissan's most brilliant car ever."
